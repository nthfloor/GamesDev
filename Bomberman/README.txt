This game was programmed by Nathan Floor FLRNAT001

The game is based around the theme of bomberman.
It was programmed in C#, using VS 2008 and XNA 3.1, so these are required to run the game.

The following features were included:

1. The game supports two player gameplay.
2. Its primarily grid based, except for primary movement, which is pixel based.
3. There is basic AI, where the computer randomly selects directions to move and when to lay bombs etc.
4. There is Xbox support, both for the single and two player game-modes.
5. There is a basic menu systemk to navigate between main menu, pause manu, new game and game-over menu.
6. There are basic animations for player and enemy movement as well as explosions.
7. The player has a sprint feature as wellas all characters can shoot, over and above laying bombs.
8. While playing a continuous list of recent kills or points gained will be displayed in the top-left hand corner of the screen.

To win this game you have to play for a minute and try and get the highest score. If you die early and your score is still higher than the computer, then you win, else you loose. Also, in two-player mode, bots have been included.
A summary of the scores will be displayed after each game played.

Cool, I hope you enjoy it.
