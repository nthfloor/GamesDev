UCT Games development projects
==============================

I have spent 2 years studying games development and graphics at UCT in South Africa.
These are just some of the projects I have worked on. 
The bigger ones such as fly-dragonfly and Nebulon12 were all team based.

I have used a variety of technologies and frameworks for each of the projects,
ranging from Java, C++, OpenGL, C# and XNA.
